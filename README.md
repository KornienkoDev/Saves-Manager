# Saves Manager v1.4

This program is for backup and restoring saves files from the games. It is designed for those who often reinstall Windows and get tired of manually backing up all the saves or losing them. All info about your games is stored in "storage.dat".

For cloud backup you can install dropbox and backup saves there.
Btw if you want to restore your saves on clean Windows install - make sure your username is the same as before reinstalling Windows. Or just fix your username in "storage.dat". It supports 3 languages: EN, UA, RU.
